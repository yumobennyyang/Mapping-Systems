## Introduction

_Mapping Systems_ will introduce CDP students to programming concepts and methods for spatial analysis, as well as their role in the production and interpretation of spatial data.

The course will focus on building proficiency in Python-based workflows focused on finding, describing, and visualizing spatial data; manipulating and drawing meaning from data layers; understanding distance and spatial relatedness; and measuring change over time. While a primary goal of this course is to introduce students to practical tools and workflows and build fluency in their use, the course will also introduce students to some historical and conceptual context, as well as case studies.

The course will require students to complete exercises to gain proficiency in spatial analytic tools in service of being able to use said tools in their computational design practice.

## Learning Objectives

At the most basic level, the goal of this class is to introduce students to mapping in Python and demonstrate how to explore, analyze, and visualize spatial data. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Load, explore, and visualize spatial data in Python
- Understand and apply basic geoprocessing techniques
- Measure distance and spatial relatedness
- Analyze change over time

Furthermore, students should develop a deeper understanding of how spatial data is used in decision-making, and challenges associated with using data to inform arguments (agency in mapping; objective vs subjective / abstract vs experiential).

## Course Organization / Communication

Class meets on Tuesdays and Thursday in 300 Buell South from 6-8pm. Weeks will generally be organized as follows:
**Tuesday**: Lecture, reading discussion, review of technical concepts
**Thursday**: Tutorials, desk crits for exercises and colloquium final project

Conversation topics that pertain to the entire class, such as meeting time/location or technical difficulties / troubleshooting can live in the course Discord channel. All other questions can be sent to me directly via email at mag2382@columbia.edu.

All slides and tutorials will be posted to the course's [Github repository](https://github.com/mapping-systems/cdp-mapping-systems). All exercises will be saved and managed via Github (details below).

## Office Hours

Office hours are by appointment, and preferable on Tuesday or Thursdays before or after class. Email me to schedule a time to chat.
